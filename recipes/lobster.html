        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you're planning a celebration menu, why not create a restaurant-caliber stuffed lobster dish at home. It's a great centerpiece for a fancy meal and perfect for a birthday, anniversary, Valentine's Day, or New Year's Eve. To make this dish, fresh lobster is stuffed with a savory cracker mixture flavored with sweet onion, celery, garlic, and Parmesan cheese. The dish is then baked in the oven for a quick and elegant meal for two.</p>

        <p>This impressive dish should have some worthy sides, such as creamy clam chowder or zesty gazpacho. Pan-roasted asparagus with lemon and garlic is a wonderful accompaniment, as is a simple risotto. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <li>(1 1/4- to 1 1/2-pound) live lobster</li>
                <li>cup buttery cracker crumbs, such as Ritz or Club</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted, plus more for serving if desired</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons minced celery</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons minced sweet onion</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon lemon pepper</li>
                <li>Dash of salt, or to taste</li>
                <li>Dash of sweet Hungarian paprika</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 F.</li>
            <li>To instantly kill the lobster, place the lobster flat on a cutting board and plunge the tip of a sharp knife straight down just behind the lobster's eyes to cut the spinal cord. (Alternatively, you can freeze the lobster for 30 to 60 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Flip the lobster over on its back. Using a sharp knife or kitchen shears, cut the lobster's body cavity open all the way down to the end of the tail but not all the way through.</li>
            <li>Remove and reserve the tomalley (yellowish-green colored liver).</li>
            <li>Remove the stomach and intestines, being careful not to rupture them, and discard.</li>
            <li>Rinse the lobster cavity and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the cracker crumbs, melted butter, celery, onion, 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, lemon pepper, and salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Add the tomalley from the lobster and mix gently.</li>
            <li>Pack the cracker mixture into the lobster's body cavity.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with the remaining tablespoon of Parmesan cheese and dust lightly with paprika. </li>
            <li>Bake the stuffed lobster in an uncovered 2-inch-deep baking pan for 30 minutes. If needed, place under the broiler and broil for another 2 minutes to brown the stuffing. Serve the stuffed lobster immediately with melted butter on the side, if desired.</li>
        </ol>

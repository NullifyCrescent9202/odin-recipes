        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pan-seared salmon is an excellent option for a weeknight meal. It cooks quickly, and you can use this basic cooking technique for other types of fish or give it your own spin with extra flavors and ingredients.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Four (approximately 7-ounce) salmon fillets, skin on</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
            <li>4 lemon wedges, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Pat the salmon dry with paper towels. If you have time, let the salmon sit out at room temperature for up to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season the salmon fillets on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Set a large heavy skillet or cast-iron pan over medium heat and add the oil. Allow it to preheat for a few minutes until the oil starts to shimmer.</li>
            <li>Add the salmon skin-side down, and sear for 4 to 5 minutes or until the skin is nicely browned and releases easily from the pan.</li>
            <li>Flip the salmon fillets and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes or until they reach an internal temperature of 125 F.</li>
            <li>Transfer the salmon fillets to a serving plate and let them rest for 5 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges to squeeze over the fillets.</li>
        </ol>
